          <p class="date">10 June 2014</p>
          <p>I started studying HTML &amp; CSS on April 8, 2014 with a bootleg copy of <em>HTML &amp; CSS for Dummies</em>. While it all seems elementary now, it took a painfully long time to get the hang of layouts, positioning, and css syntax initially. Even worse, I had no clue as to how to put this stuff to use and I felt that I had nothing to sink my teeth into. On a blog somewhere, a developer recommended that it was good practice to recreate the layout of a site.

            So, what better than <a href="http://google.com">Google's</a> simple homepage?

          <h1>Easing into JavaScript</h1>
          <h2>A birthday present to myself</h2>
          <p class="date">10 Jul 2014</p>
          <p>I was reading everywhere that Javascript was the language of the web. This didn't make any sense to me, considering that I had been clearly making site layouts with html/css, even though they were amateurish. Additionally, numerous commenters on stack exchange and corners of the web were saying that html/css weren't programming languages, that JavaScript lets you control the *behavior* of a site.  I had no idea what the hell everyone was talking about, but one thing was clear.
          <br><br>
          I was going to have to learn JavaScript
          <br><br>
          On June 2, my birthday, I put my shoulder to the wheel and began a tutorial on udemy.com. Looking back, the tutorial was very outdated and awfully lame, but we all start somewhere. I later moved over to treehouse where I started to wrap my mind around the fundamentals of the language: variables, primitive values, arrays, objects, functions. I was confused as hell. It didn't make sense as to how any of this related to web development and the HTML and CSS that I had been studying.
          <br><br>
          Then there was the logic: if-else, iterating, passing arguments to functions, logical operators. Then there was the JavaScript syntax: function declarations vs. function expressions, anonymous functions, native properties and methods for strings/arrays/numbers/objects. It was overwhelming and I felt an acute sense of stress.
          <br><br>
          But I continued. I started to learn jQuery since I was reading that many JavaScript developers were saying that it was a lifesaver. I used jQuery to manipulate elements on the page and then I got the hang of event-handling.
          <br><br>
          <br><br>
          Through my endless perusing of forums, blog comments, and other miscellanea, I read that a common interview 'test' for junior developers was to create a program called 'Fizz Buzz;. Basically, you iterate over an array of numbers (1-100) and print the series. But there's a catch: For every third element, you print 'Fizz' rather than the number. For every 5th element, you print 'Buzz'. And for those elements that are both 3rd and 5th you print 'Fizz Buzz'.
          <br><br>
          At this point, I had logged about a month of studying JavaScript and subsequently <strong>jQuery</strong>, I was able to solve it. My solution was ugly, but I got it done.  I ended up refactoring it so that a number entered in an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag and the page would iterate and print the 'Fizz Buzz' up to that number.

          <p class="date">15 Aug 2014</p>
          <p>I was making progress and things were looking better but not good. I was studying furiously, averaging 4-6 hours a day. I tried to create a mock-landing page for a mock-architecture firm.
